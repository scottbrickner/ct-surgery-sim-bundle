# CT Surgery Sim Bundle

Bundled, cross-syncing training simulation for a CT (cardiothoracic) surgery nursing class at Keck: three device simulators — **Philips IntelliVue** patient monitor, **Edwards HemoSphere Alta** hemodynamic monitor, and a **Medtronic 5392** temporary pacemaker — driven by one shared physiology engine and one facilitator console, running a single continuous cardiogenic-shock case (bedside settle-in → tamponade/arrest → ECMO cannulation).

Training simulation only. Not for clinical use.

**Full spec: [`docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md`](docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md)** — read this first. It has the reuse inventory, architecture decisions, the transcribed flagship scenario, and the phased build plan. This README just orients you in the repo; the build prompt is the source of truth.

## Status

**Phase 0 complete** — this is a straight, unmodified port of three existing prototypes into one repo. Nothing has been wired together yet. Each device still runs its own local state; there is no shared physiology engine, no unified sync, and no consolidated scenario schema yet. See `docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md` §9 for what Phase 1 onward looks like.

## Running it today (pre-Phase-1)

Each device HTML file is fully standalone — open any one directly in a browser, no server or build step needed. They don't talk to each other yet. The relay (`relay/server.js`) is the pacemaker sim's existing pairing mechanism; running it (`npm install && node server.js` inside `relay/`) lets a second pacemaker-sim window/device join over WebSocket, but the two monitor sims don't yet participate in that channel — that's Phase 1–3 work per the build prompt.

## Source projects

- Pacemaker engine + relay ported from `~/pacemaker-sim` (git history, phase docs, and the deployed Netlify/relay snapshot live there and at `~/Claude/Projects/Knowledge Hub | Critical Care/5392 Pacemaker Simulator/`).
- IntelliVue + HemoSphere Alta prototypes ported from `~/Claude/Projects/Nurse Residency/Sim Monitors - IntelliVue & HemoSphere/`.
